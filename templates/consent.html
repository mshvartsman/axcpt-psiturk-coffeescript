                    <h3>TITLE OF RESEARCH: Dynamics of Context Updating in Prefrontal Cortex <br />
                    <small>

<p>
    The following informed consent is required by Princeton University for any person involved in a research study conducted by investigators at the University.  This study has been approved by the University's Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects.
</p>
<p>You will be asked to perform a task which involves stimuli (letters, pictures, or symbols) appearing on a computer screen, to which you will be asked to respond by pressing a button. You might need to remember and recognize stimuli, or remember which stimulus corresponds to which rule of the game. You will be rewarded a baseline of $1 for your participation, plus up to $5 for maximizing points in the game. We may end the experiment early if you cannot learn the rules of the task. If the experiment ends early by your choice or ours, you will receive the $1 baseline and the bonus obtained up to this point. 
</p>
